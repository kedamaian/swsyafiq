Welcome to kedamaian.

kedamaian began as a new platform for [my personal blog][1], but has now taken
on a life of its own as an open source website for Jekyll.

The theme has been designed with simplicity and readability in mind. It makes
use of third party services such as Disqus to ensure the blog has
all the features you would expect from a dynamic application such as Wordpress
but with the hosting and maintenance simplicity of Jekyll.

Please use/copy/share kedamaian!
