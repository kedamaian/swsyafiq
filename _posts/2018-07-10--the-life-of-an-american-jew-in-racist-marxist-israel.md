title: ' The Life of an American Jew in Racist Marxist Israel'
---
Written in 1985 by _JACK BERNSTEIN_

Before Israel became a state in 1948, Jews worldwide were filled with Zionist propaganda that Israel would be a homeland for all Jews, a refuge for persecuted Jews, a democratic country and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
 
I am an Ashkenazi Jew who spent the first 25 years of my life in the United States, the country that has given ALL Jews freedom and the opportunity to prosper—and prosper we Jews did, to the point that one portion of the Jews (the Zionists) have gained a position of political and economic dominance in the US.
 
To fully understand the story I am about to tell, it is important that you understand what Zionism really is. Zionist propaganda has led the American people to believe that Zionism and Judaism are one and the same and that they are religious in nature. This is a blatant lie. 
 
Judaism is a religion; but Zionism is a political movement started mainly by East European (Ashkenazi) Jews who for centuries have been the main force behind communism/socialism. The ultimate goal of the Zionists is one ONE-WORLD GOVERNMENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ZIONISTS AND THE ZIONIST-ORIENTED JEWISH INTERNATIONAL BANKERS.
 
Communism/socialism are merely tools to help them accomplish their goal.

**I was a Victim of Zionist Propaganda**
After the 1967 War, we Jews were filled with pride that ‘our homeland’ had become so powerful and successful. Then too, we had been filled with the false propaganda that Jews in America were being persecuted. So, between 1967 and 1970 approximately 50,000 American Jews fell for this Zionist propaganda and migrated to Israel. I was one of those suckers. 
 
After being filled with all this false Zionist propaganda, I felt that I would have a better chance to succeed in the new Jewish state. There was an added enticement, the spirit and challenge of pioneering and of helping my fellow Jews.
 
**Dual Citizenship**
I had no emotional conflict with leaving the US because I was still able to keep my US citizenship and could return to the US at any time. You see, Jews are allowed to be citizens of both Israel and some countries—US is one of those countries. The US government allows a Jew to be a citizen of both US and Israel.
 
German Americans cannot be citizens of both the US and Germany. Italian Americans cannot be citizen of both US and Italy. Egyptian-Americans cannot be citizens of both the US and Egypt.. BUT, a Jewish American can be a citizen of both Israel and the US THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE POWER THE ZIONIST JEWS HAVE OVER THE US GOVERMENT. 

**I Arrive in the “Jewish Paradise”**
Before leaving for Israel, a Jewish friend of mine had made arrangements for me to stay a few days with her sister, Fawzia Daboul and her spinster aunt. After arriving at Lod Airport just outside of Tel Aviv, I took a bus to the home of Miss Daboul and her aunt. When I saw Fawzia, it was love at first sight. I started calling her ‘Ziva,’ her Hebrew name. Ziva is a Sephardic Jewess from Iraq who, like myself, had fallen for the Zionist propaganda and had migrated to Israel. She was employed as a hairdresser.

**The Kibbutz**
After visiting with Ziva and her aunt for two days, I left to spend 6 months at Kibbutz ‘Ein Hashofet’ one of the well over 150 such communes then operating in Israel. Since then, many more have been started—especially in the territory taken from the Palestinian Arabs. A kibbutz is a farming and sometimes industrial venture. It is important to explain that Israel’s Kibbutz system is a Marxist idea brought to Israel by the Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Israel mainly from Poland and Russia. These Jews are part of that bunch of Jews know as the BOLSHEVIKS. Before 1917, they were the force that laid the foundation for the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 in Russia and the start of Communism.
 
Again, I want to point out, even emphasize, that it is some of that same bunch of Ashkenazi, Communist/Socialist Jews who migrated to Israel, gained control of the Zionist Movement and have dominated the government of Israel since its beginning in 1948.
 
Now, back to the Kibbutz —

Prior to 1967, most of the work on the Kibbutz was done by Jews. But, since the 1967 War, the work has been done by Arabs who are paid a very low wage, and by volunteers from overseas. Members of the Kibbutz (all Jews) share all things equally. They receive clothing, food and a small allowance. All profits from the venture go into the Kibbutz account for future use. EACH OF THESE KIBBUTZ ARE AFFILIATED WITH ONE OF ISRAEL’S MARXIST PARTIES ranging from SOCIALIST TO HARD-CORE COMMUNIST.
 
The Kibbutz I was in was not hardcore communist. Yet, I was happy to leave after 4 months—two months earlier than originally planned. During the time I was working in the Kibbutz, I carried on courtship with Ziva. She was one of the reasons I left the Kibbutz after only 4 months—we were to be married.
 
**Our Marriage Created Problems**
The marriage ceremony was held in the Sephardic Synagogue. The ceremony was simple but beautiful. Ziva and I were happy, but our marriage created serious problems. You see, Ziva is a Sephardic Jewess and I am an Ashkenazi Jew. For an Ashkenazi Jew to marry a Sephardic Jew is frowned upon in Israel by the ruling Ashkenazis. To understand why this is the case, you must realize the difference between the Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews.
 
The powerful Zionist propaganda machine has led the American people to believe that a Jew is a Jew—one race of people and that they are “God’s Chosen People.” I will deal with the “God’s Chosen People” LIE later. First, it is important for you to understand that Jews are NOT one race of people.
 
There are two distinct groups of Jews in the world and they come from two different areas of the world—the Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and North Africa and the Ashkenazi Jews come from Eastern Europe. The Sephardic is the oldest group and it is they, if any, who are the Jews described in the Bible because they lived in the area described in the Bible. They are blood relatives to the Arabs—the only difference between them is the religion.
 
The Ashkenazi Jews, who now compromise 90% of the Jews in the world, had a rather strange beginning. According to historians, many of them Jewish, the Ashkenazi Jews came into existence about 1,200 years ago. It happened this way:
 
At the eastern edge of Europe, there lived a tribe of people know as the Khazars. About the year AD740, the Khazar king and his court decided they should adopt a religion for their people. So, representatives of the three major religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, were invited to present their religious doctrines. The Khazars chose Judaism, but it wasn’t for religious reasons. If the Khazars had chosen Islam, they would have angered the strong Christian world. If they had chosen Christianity, they would have angered the strong Islamic world. So, they played it safe—they chose Judaism. It wasn’t for religious reasons the Khazars chose Judaism; it was for political reasons.
 
Sometime during the 13th century, the Khazars were driven from their land and they migrated westward with most of them settling in Poland and Russia. These Khazars are now known as Ashkenazi Jews. Because these Khazar Ashkenazi Jews merely chose Judaism, they are not really Jews—at least not blood Jews. 
 
Throughout their history, these Polish and Russian Ashkenazi Jews practiced communism/socialism and worked to have their ideas implemented in these countries.
 
By the late 1800s significant numbers of these communist/socialist Jews were found in Germany, the Balkans and eventually all over Europe. Because of their interference in the social and governmental affairs of Russia, they became the target of persecution by the Czars. Because of this, migration of these communist/socialist oriented Jews began. Some went to Palestine; some to Central and South America; and a large number of them came to the US.

**Political Zionism is Born**
In 1897, the First Zionist Congress was held in Basle, Switzerland. At this Congress, it was decided to work toward the establishment of a Jewish state and a search for land on which to build this Jewish state began. Great Britain offered the Zionists land in Africa. This the Zionists rejected: they wanted Palestine! 
At the time, Palestine was inhabited by a half a million Palestinian Arabs and a few Palestinian Jews who are blood related and who had lived together in peace for centuries. With Palestine as their choice for a homeland, European Ashkenazi Jews began migrating to Palestine. As I explained earlier, most were communist/socialist oriented with some of them being radical Bolshevik communists whose aim is world domination.
 
So when you think of Jews, especially as related to Israel, keep in mind that there is a great difference between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews. They are not one united people. They are divided socially, politically and especially racially. Now, back to Ziva, a Sephardic Jewess and I an Ashkenazi Jew, and our lives in the so-called democratic country of Israel.

**Sephardic Jews—Second Class Citizens**
For the first three years of our marriage, it was necessary for us to live with Ziva’s aunt. This was because of the critical housing shortage in Israel and because of racism. Housing is allotted as follows:
 

    Ashkenazi Jews who have lived in Israel for many years are given first choice.
    Second in line are Ashkenazi Jews from Europe—especially if they are married or marry an Israel-born Ashkenazi Jew.
    The next favored are Ashkenazi Jews from the US.—especially if they marry an Israeli born Ashkenazi.
    Sephardic Jews have the next choice of whatever housing is left.
    At the bottom of the list are Moslems, Druze and Christians.
    
Opportunities for employment follow the same pattern: Ashkenazi Jews get the choicest jobs, Sephardic Jews next, and Moslem, Druze and Christians fill the menial jobs with a great many left unemployed. Even through I was an Ashkenazi Jew from the US, I was placed lower on the list for housing because I married a Sephardic Jewess.
 
Being denied housing was my second experience of the intense racism that exists in Israel. From the very beginning of my arrival in Israel, many slurs were yelled at me. We American Jews were merely being tolerated. Because Israel, to survive, must depend on gifts of American Jews and the sale of worthless Israeli Bonds in America, there is jealousy among the elite Israeli Ashkenazi Jews toward American Jews, even if the American Jews are also Ashkenazi. Many times I was told, “Go Home!” and, “We want your money, but not you.”
 
However, there was a portion of the American Jews who were welcome and given favored treatment. They were the card-carrying communist Jews. 
Of the 50.000 American Jews who, like myself, had migrated to Israel between 1967 and 1970 about 20% (10.000) of them were Marxist oriented with a great number of them actual card-carrying communists. They were welcomed by the Israeli authorities and local Ashkenazi and were given favored treatment—housing, jobs and social life. It must be noted besides coming from the US, a great number of communist Jews were migrating to Israel from Chile, Argentina and South Africa.
 
Of the 50.000 who had migrated to Israel during that time, 80% of us eventually returned to the US. The 20% who remained were those who were card-carrying communists or sympathetic to Marxism. 

**Three Faces of Israel**
From what I have told you so far, you must have the idea that Israel is a Marxist (socialist/communist) country. This would be correct. But, Israel has three faces: Communism, Fascism and democracy. The Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Israel from Russia brought with them the ideology of socialism/communism and have put into practice much of that ideology. The Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Israel from Germany, while sympathetic to communism and support it, tend to favor the practices of Nazi-style fascism. During World War II, in Germany these elite Zionist Ashkenazi Jews worked closely with Hitler’s Gestapo in persecuting the lower class German Jews and delivering them to concentration camps.
 
Now living in Israel, these elite Zionist Jews, who were well trained in Nazi-style fascism and favor it, have imposed many facets of fascism on Israel. To give the impression that Israel is a democracy, members of the Knesset (Israel Congress) are elected—an odd type of election. This is where Israel’s so-called democracy stops. It doesn’t make any difference which party wins an election, the LIKUD or LABOR, the elite Zionist Jews rule in a dictatorial manner—giving favors to the elite clique and brutally suppressing any dissent.
 
In the Zionist/communist scheme of world domination, it is Israel’s role to continually stir up trouble in the Middle East. Since wars are a big part of this scheme of aggression, it is only natural that from early childhood on, Israeli youth are trained mentally and physically for war. For instance: Israel has its equivalent of Hitler’s youth group. It is the Gadna; and all high school and junior high students are required to participate—boys and girls. Like Hitler’s youth group, the youth in Israel’s Gadna are dressed in khaki uniforms. They take training and engage in paramilitary exercises.
 
Even at play, guns and thoughts of war are present. When on a picnic, instead of taking along baseball or soccer equipment, they take sub-machine guns and assault rifles and practice shooting and playing military games.
 
Once graduated from high school, all young boys are required to serve 3 years in the army (2 years for girls) or 4 years in the navy or air force (3 for girls). Ultraorthodox religious Jews are exempt from military service.
 
Once out of the service, a number of the ex-service people join the Shin Bet, the equivalent of Hitler’s Gestapo. Like the Gestapo, they engage in repressing anyone who acts or speaks out against the Marxist/Fascist government of Zionist dominated Israel.
 
Like in Nazi Germany, all people in Israel are required to carry identity booklets called “Teudat Zehut” in Hebrew.
 
One day I changed jackets and forgot to take out my ID booklet when I went down town in Tel Aviv. A police officer approached me and asked for my “Teudat Zehut”. I told him I had left it in my other jacket. Because I didn’t have my ID booklet with me, I was taken to the police station. At the police station, the desk sergeant informed me that for not having my ID booklet with me, I could be jailed for up to 16 days without even being taken before a judge. All that was necessary is for the Police Lieutenant to sign a “Remand Order”.
 
I asked permission to make a telephone call to my wife and tell her to bring my ID booklet to the station.
 
The sergeant allowed me two hours to have my “Teudat Zehut” produced. I called my wife and she brought my “Teudat Zehut”—arriving just minutes before the 2 hour deadline expired. If she had been late in arriving, I would have been jailed for 16 days for not having my ID booklet with me. This is just one indication that Israel is a ‘Police State’ and not a democracy.
 
Concerning Nazism/Fascism, please let me clear a point. Germans are an admirable people—I dare say even great. But in Germany, the general population were victims of the Nazis who through cunning and brutality gained power. In Germany, the average Jews were victims of the Zionist elite who worked hand in hand with the Nazis. Many of those same Zionist Jews who, in Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined hands with the Zionist/Communist Jews from Poland and Russia. It is the two faces of communism and Nazi-style fascism that rule Israel. Democracy is merely an illusion. 
 
Regarding the tie between the elite Ashkenazi Jew and the Nazis, take a look at the word ‘Ashkenazi’—look again ‘Ashke-NAZI’. 
Interesting isn’t it?
 
There is a great confusion regarding the relationship of fascism to communism. Fascism is national socialism. Communism is international socialism.

**Israel’s Economy**
Economically, Israel is bankrupt. Of course, this could have been predicted because Israel’s economic structure is based on socialism.
 
Whenever a government of a state and its citizens spend more money than the value of the goods produced, economic bankruptcy will result. If it were not for aid from America, Israel’s economy would have collapsed long ago. Israel is a ‘welfare state’ in every sense of the word—it is America’s most favored welfare recipient. 
 
While America’s farmers, small businessmen and laborers are struggling to survive, the US Government, dominated by Zionist Jews, are draining the pockets and purses of American taxpayers to support Israel’s socialist economy and war machine.
 
Since the Israeli government knows, and the favored Zionists know, that the Zionist pressure in America will ensure that America will keep sending them massive amounts of money, Israel’s government and its favored citizens spend money like drunken sailors. This practice leads to inflation and eventually to an economic collapse.
 
Comparing Israel to drunken sailors is unfair to sailors. Sailors spend their OWN money—Israel spends money it gets from America. Because Israel is a welfare state depending mainly on American aid for survival, it is on a down-hill slide. In 1982, Israel’s inflation rate was 130%.
 
In 1983, it was 200%, and this year (1984) it is expected to exceed 400%. That means a hamburger that cost $1.00 last January will have risen to $5.00 by the end of December. History shows that no nation mired in economic problems as Israel has become, has ever avoided an economic collapse. Only with a massive increase in American financial aid can an economic collapse be averted—even then, this solution would only be temporary.
 
Regarding the destructive tendencies of socialism, there are circumstances that allow a country to successfully provide social programs to help its people. It is possible in a country that has sufficient financial resource and where its citizens are deeply religious and considerate toward their fellowmen.
 
NONE of this exists in Israel. Even in countries where conditions are ideal there lingers a danger. Since the government of the country provides for the needs of its citizens, most of these citizens have a tendency to lose incentive to work hard; and a country with a complacent citizenry is easily conquered.

**Visitors to Israel**
Tourism is one of Israel’s main sources of income. The largest group of visitors are American Jews. But, there are also many American Christians who want to visit the holy shrines and to see the land of ‘God’s Chosen People’.
 
These Christians come away very impressed and filled with religious fervor.
 
While in Israel, Jews and Gentiles alike are carefully watched so that they do not stray and happen to see the sordid side of Israel—the true Israel.
Like in Soviet Russia and other communist countries, visitors to Israel are taken on carefully planned guided tours. They are shown the religious sites, the universities, the lush orchards, the technical accomplishments, the arts, and to stir sympathy, they are taken to visit the Holocaust Museum. But, kept from the eyes of the tourists are the ghettos, the prisons where political prisoners, mostly Arabs and Sephardic Jews, are subjected to the most inhumane forms of torture. The tourists do not see the widespread crime activities and the corruption and cooperation between organized crime bosses and government and police officials.
 
The tourists do not learn of the true inner workings of Israel’s Marxist/Fascist government; nor do they see Israel’s Racism.
 
I met one American Tourist who couldn’t help telling me about the wonderful religious feeling she had from being in Israel—the Holy Land. I remarked to her, “Just try giving a Bible to a local Jew and you will see how much religion and religious freedom there is in Israel. If seen by the police, you will be arrested.

**Religion**
The land on which the present state of Israel has been built, formerly Palestine, was once walked upon by Moses, Jesus and Muhammad.
 
Since Palestine was the site of many religious events and has many religious sites, it is rightfully referred to as the HOLY LAND. So, one would think that Palestine, now Israel, would tend to have an air of holiness about it.
 
When Palestinian Moslems and Palestinian Jews occupied Palestine, there was a religious aura. But, Since the Zionists took over the area and set up the state of Israel, it is one of the most sinful nations in the world where only 5% of the Jews are religious. It is interesting to note that those who are strongly religious are Arab Moslems and Arab Christians who make up a small minority in Israel.
 
Israeli laws suppress all religion—or instance, it is against the law to try and convert a Jew to another religion even if the Jew is an atheist or humanist.
A Christian is permitted to preach the gospel in a church building, but for the clergy or anyone to even tell one about teachings in the Bible outside the church building will bring a 5 years prison sentence.
 
For a Christian to give a Bible or religious article to a Jew will also bring a 5 years sentence. Even an act of kindness by a Christian toward a Jew, such as giving a gift of food, can be interpreted as trying to convert the Jew to Christianity and can bring a 5 year prison sentence.
 
This same law of religious suppression applies to those of the Islamic faith who in an act of kindness give a gift of any kind to a Jew. A 5 year prison sentence can result.
 
The treatment of religious Jews is touchy for the ruling Zionists. World-wide, Jews and non-Jews view Israel as a land where Jews may practice their religion without persecution. Therefore, the Zionists do not dare risk suppressing Judaism for fear of arousing world opinion against them. So, the ruling Zionists merely tolerate the religious practices of the small minority of religious Jews in Israel.
 
**God’s Chosen People**
The American people have been led to believe that Jews are “God’s Chosen People”. This myth was started by a small group of Jews. A few Jewish leaders took excerpts from the Bible and interpreted them as “Chosen People”. But, isn’t it odd that it is not the religious Jews who claim to be “God’s Chosen People.” It is the atheistic non-believing Jews who claim that honor. 
 
Leading the cry, “We are God’s Chosen People” are the Zionist/Marxist (Ashkenazi) Jews who for political purposes chose Judaism and who don’t have a drop of biblical Jewish blood in them. 
 
One Israeli religious Jew said it well, “At one time we Jews were chosen by God to be his messengers. But, long ago we forfeited that right”.
 
Anyone who has read the Bible with an open mind knows that God gave Jews of that time special favors. But, it was in the form of covenants. In these covenants were conditions — the conditions were that God demanded the Jews obey His Word. Time after time the Jews broke the covenants. They rejected God and turned to adoring mammon. It doesn’t take a biblical scholar to realize that long ago even the real Jews lost the right of being God’s chosen people.
 
In comparing the degree to which the followers of the **3 major religions practice their beliefs**, I make this observation:
 
**Judaism**—Few Jews, **Sephardic** or **Ashkenazi**, are religious. This is true in America, in Israel and world-wide.

![khazars6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/khazars6.png)

Christianity—The Christians’ religion has felt the influence of Jewish meddling and infiltration (especially in America) resulting in confusion and bickering between the various Christian denominations. This has led to a ‘lukewarm’ attitude among most Christians toward their religion. There is evidence to prove that Jews, or one of their many fronts, have started many of the Christian denominations and thus dominate doctrine. 
 
Islam—Moslems, who follow the teachings of Islam, are by far the most fervent of the 3 major religions in following their religious beliefs.

The Judeo-Christian ethic we hear so much about in America is a big joke—the result of an intense Zionist propaganda campaign.

I’ll toss in one last thought about the “God’s Chosen People” myth: God said, ‘Beware of those who call themselves Jews and are not, for they lie’. Could it be the Ashkenazi Jews are the people to whom God was referring? 

The Zionist controlled news-media in America has kept from the American people the news that Israel is intensely racist. Most Ashkenazi Jews in America are not aware of the racism in Israel. Even those Jews who have visited Israel are not aware because they are carefully kept from witnessing racist incidents.
However, Sephardic Jews in America have spread the truth about the practice of racism against the Sephardic Jews in Israel. Knowing of this, Sephardic Jews have not been among those Jews who migrated to Israel from America.
 
From what I have written so far, you should now realize that few Jews practice Judaism. Most Jews are atheists or they follow humanism which is anti-God religion. So the portrayal that Jews are a religious people who look to Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy is a myth. Also, the portrayal that Jews are one race of people is a myth. The Sephardic Jew—Ashkenazi Jew division is adequate proof.
 
RACISM AS PRACTICED IN ISRAEL IS ONE REASON THAT ISRAEL WILL SOONER OR LATER DESTROY ITSELF.



**ISRAEL - SATAN'S PLAYGROUND**
No country could have become as corrupt and sinful as has Israel through a normal chain of events. It would seem that there had to be some evil force at work.

It would be well to note the evil history of the leadership of Israel and their followers. For centuries, they (the Bolshevik Jews) practiced atheistic Socialism/Communism in various European countries, especially Russia.

These Bolshevik (Ashkenazic) Jews, along with the Zionist oriented Jewish International Bankers, succeeded in overthrowing the Czar of Russia and imposing communist rule on the Russian people. With the aid of Bolshevik Jews who migrated from Russia to America, they have been able to spread their evil, satanic influence
throughout America and extending world-wide.

Many of these communist Jews from Russia and other European countries, who migrated to Israel, took with them the socialist/communist ideas of Karl Marx. With the help of American Bolshevik Jews, they were able to take control of Israel and impose the socialist/communist plans of Karl Marx.

Running parallel to the Bolshevik movement was the Zionist movement, which had basically the same goals - world domination. At some point after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the Bolsheviks and Zionists meshed together and became one.

They are now commonly referred to as Zionists.

During Biblical times, God promised the Jews of those days to be his messengers and he gave them special privileges - if they would obey his word.

The Bible tells how these Jews disobeyed his word and began adoring idols. Frustrated over the disobedience of the Jews, God said, "Ye are of the synagogue of Satan".

The atheistic Zionist leaders of Israel and their followers have apparently adopted the "synagogue of Satan" and through their leadership have made Israel a virtual "Satan's Playground".

In trying to give a true picture of the real Israel, I can best do so by taking you behind the scenes by relating my own personal experiences and observations.


**WHO IS A JEW?**
Most American Gentiles have been led to believe that a Jew is a Jew - one class of people. This is a falsehood which has been perpetuated by the Zionist controlled mass news-media. History shows that most people who are referred to as Jews in the world are not Jews - at least not brood Jews.

There are Chinese Jews, black Jews, Indian Jews, etc., but the basic difference is in two divisions- Ashkenazic Jews and Sephardic Jews. They have different historical backgrounds and are from different parts of the world. These differences must be emphasised and understood by Gentiles, especially Christians, if there is to be a peaceful solution to the Mideast problems.

Sephardic Jews are native to North Africa and the Mideast. Usually darker skinned than Ashkenazic Jews, they are blood related to the Arabs. In fact they are commonly and rightfully referred to as Arab Jews. Both the Sephardic Jews and Arabs are known as Semites, the descendants of Shem.

These semetic people, the Arab (Sephardic) Jews, Arab Moslems and Arab Christians had lived together in peace for centuries.

Ashkenazic Jews became Jews in a strange manner. It happened this way:

History records that there existed in western Asia a warlike tribe known as the Khazars. They were pagans (idol worshipers) who engaged in sexual excesses of the vilest forms. This resulted in the moral decay of its people and of the Khazar empire.

About 750 A.D. their leader, King Bulan, decided to adopt a "one God" religion for his people, so he invited representatives of Christianity, Islam and Judaism to present their dogma. 

**King Bulan chose Judaism**
If he had chosen Christianity, it would have aroused the anger of the large number of followers of Islam in the surrounding area; and if he had chosen Islam, it would have aroused the anger of the large number of Christians around them. So, he played it safe - he chose Judaism.

If the teachings of the Torah, the religious book of Judaism, had been followed by these Khazars, the history of the world would undoubtedly have been much different - and for the better. But, it seems the King and his court were more interested in the Talmud than the Torah.

Most non-Jews think of the Talmud as a religious book. Actually, the Talmud is 63 books written by a small number of rabbis to be used by Jews as civil law and guide.

These Khazars were driven from their land by the Mongols, so they moved westward and settled mainly in Russia and Poland. Over the years, descendants of the Khazars became known as Ashkenazic Jews. 


**ASHKENAZIC JEWS ARE NOT SEMITES**
Before going any farther, it is important to point out to Gentiles, especially Christians, that Ash-kenazic Jews are not Semites.

Virtually all Zionists are Ashkenzic Jews. When anyone criticizes wrongful acts by the Zionists, they cry out, with false indignity, "You're anti-semetic." Yet, these Ashkenazic (Zionist) Jews are not Semites.

To be a Semite it is necessary to be a descendant of Shem. Ashkenazic Jews are not descendants of
Shem, but descendants of Japhath.

Sephardic (Arab) Jews, along with Arab Moslems and Arab Christians, are descendants of Shem and thus Semites.

Since Ashkenazic Jews are not descendants of Shem, but descendants of Japhath, they are not Semetic
Jews - they are artificial Jews. Being artificial
Jews, they have no biblical right to Palestine,
now wrongfully called Israel. 

Communism is Judaism
What all people must realize is that Communism is Judaism.  No Jews – no Communism
