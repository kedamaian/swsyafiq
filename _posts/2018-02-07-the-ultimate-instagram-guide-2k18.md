THIS IS ALL COMPLETELY FREE. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

**Step One: Creating your profile.**

In this section we will touch upon setting up your profile.
When creating your profile the first thing you should know is what niche do you want?

List of niche idea's:
- Luxury/Money
- Sad Quotes
- Video Textposts
- Textposts
- Memes
- Success/Motivation
- Weed
- Hypebeast
- Clothing


After picking your niche, you need a username. Your username should not only fit your niche, but look nice. A username between 1-10 characters would be ideal, anything longer just looks messy.

Next you want to have a profile picture. Profile pictures of a female such as Kylie Jenner are quite popular now and look nice with your account, of course if you have a Luxury/Money account, you may want a photo of someone flexing money, who knows.

After finding a profile picture, your bio and display name are a necessity. Nobody will follow you if you do not have these. For your display name, you can put your nice or something like, ur cute, hoping someone will see it and follow you. As for your bio, you want to have something short and clean. A popular bio is "follow me before I'm famous," or "follow me before i become hot." Either of those are short and look good on your profile.

The people you follow also say what kind of page you are. If all the accounts you follow are Meme Pages, you most likely have a Meme Page as well. This is also helpful for getting content. Follow accounts of similar niche.


**Step Two: Getting a small follower base.**

Getting a small following is a must for the beginning of a page. An extremely easy way to get a small following fast is the Celebrity method. 

Method:

Follow 30-50 Celebrities with 1 million+ followers.
Wait 2 minutes and unfollow them.
Follow them back and repeat. 

Be careful of how many times you do this and how fast or else you will get follow/unfollow blocked.

This gains you followers because this puts you at the top of the celebs 'following' list so someone who's looking at who's following the celeb may come across your account.

**Step Three: Posting; When and How Many Times?**

When you are just starting out on a new page you want to get a good amount of posts right away. Post 10 photos a day for the first few days, after that you should dial back down to about 3 a day. 3 is a great and steady amount to grow your account at. As for when you should post, spread each post out by 3 hours. Maybe one at Noon, 3, and 6.

**Step Four: Creating a Business Profile.**

In order to do this you need to link a Facebook account to it. Having a business profile on Instagram gives you plenty of insights about your account including: where your followers are from, how many followers gained/lost in a week, best times to post on each day of the week, etc. The list goes on. This is very nice and helpful to have on an Instagram account and I highly suggest doing it, but it's not needed.

**Step Five: Getting More Followers.**

In this part I will tell you some ways to get followers.
i) Investing money. Investing money is a great way to get followers, the going rate for real followers is about $1/1000, depending on your current financial state and commitment, it may or may not be worth the money.

ii) Self Promotion. Self promotion is basically manipulating people into following you. This often includes you following a bunch of pages that spam shoutouts so you can comment stuff such as "Nobody ever follows me" to gain followers. Here are some sentences that can gain you followers:

Nobody ever follows me!
I never post those spammy shoutouts!
My mom said that if I get ___ followers today she will quit smoking!

I'm sure there are plenty more you can think about, pretty self explanatory.

Last way is hitting the explore page, this get's you more activity as well as brings new people to your page. I will touch upon how to hit the explore page in the next step.

**Step Six: Maximizing Engagement & Hitting Explore Page.**

An easy way to maximize your engagement is making a slideshow every time you post. Your first photo will be the meme, or luxury post, and then include a riddle or something to boost your comments. An example of this is:

![Riddle Puzzle]({{site.baseurl}}/images/riddle-puzzles-riddles.jpg)

This photo alone will get you more than 10x the normal amount of comments you would normally get.

A very easy way to get your posts onto the explore page is by doing likes and comments with other accounts. Essentially this is where you, and a bunch of other accounts are all in a dm group. And when one of you posts, they say something along the lines of, "Like and Comment on my recent, cwd returning fast." They just like and comment on your photos. Only do this with accounts that have similar niches and amount of followers as you for the best outcomes. 
> NOTE: there is NEVER a guarantee to making it onto the explore page.


Telegram can also get you into larger groups of people with many more accounts. I do not use Telegram, just a personal preference but here is more info on that:

What do I do?:

1. Go to the app store, install Telegram.
2. Enter the URL into your browser on your PHONE.
3. Open the URL in Telegram (as it prompts you to).
4. Press "Join Group" once the Telegram app opens.
5. Click on the name of the group then press "Info".
6. In the top of the "Description" you'll see a user (the group bot), click on the name.
7. Now that you're chatting with the bot within the chat send the message "/start".
8. Now you'll be given some information about the bot and at the bottom of the message it has some buttons.
9. Press the "Add account" buttom and follow the instructions.
10. Now that you've given the bot your username and password it will likely have returned "Something went wrong!...". This is completely normal and happens everytime you add a new account.
11. Go onto the instagram app that you have your account you're trying to add signed in on and click the "This was me" popup it gave you.
12. Come back to the bot and start over again at step 7. Press "Add account" again, enter your info, press "This was me".
13. Keep repeating this process until the bot returns the message "Awesome!..." Keep in mind this may take anywhere from 5-15 times since the bot uses ALOT of proxies.

Repeat these steps for BOTH URLs. They're seperate groups, not the same thing. 

**Step Seven: Programs.**

If you are a lazy one, some of these programs may come in handy.

Buffer: [https://buffer.com/](https://buffer.com/)
Buffer is a program used to automate posts, you simply give it the content and a time to post and it does that for you. It also tracks analytics and is not too pricey.

I know nothing about this one, just seen it every here and there. Feel free to check it out.

[https://instamacro.com](https://instamacro.com)
Instamacro was first made to meet our personal needs. The idea was to get as many Instagram followers and likes as we could without having to manually do it.

Soctopbot alternative: [https://vto.pe/](https://vto.pe/) Its in russian but served the same functionality as soctop bot.

..and couple others private tools. ;P

**Step Eight: Making Money?**

After time goes on, you may reach an amount of followers where you can actually make money from your account. In my opinion, any account that has at least 50,000 followers is able to make money. You can sell shoutouts to companies, businesses, and even other members on the forum. If you need help making shoutout prices please PM me.

I have also heard some things about OG Ads. Unfortunately I cannot write a review on it as I have never personally used it, but I do have some friends who make good amounts from this. Here is the link for it: [https://ogads.com](https://ogads.com)

**Step Nine: SFS**

SFS means 'Shoutout for Shoutout.' This is just the exchanging of shoutouts with another account of relevant size to gain followers. I would not suggest doing this until you've hit around 250,000 otherwise it can easily kill your pages activity and leave you in a dump. Also, do not spam these shoutouts until you have hit 1 million or else you will be stuck in a hole.

**Step Ten: Instagram Growth Services**

Is an offer to grow your Instagram account by using a variety of growth hacking methods that are widely being used by Instagram Marketers all around the globe. Usually its pricing by a montly subscription such as $30-50/month.

PM for more private list.

**Stuff to Keep in Mind.**

Keep consistent. Don't slack when growing an account, it throws you off more than missing a class at school.

Stay in touch with your followers. Make them feel apart of a family, make them feel wanted so that they never unfollow your page!

Make friends on Instagram. You never know when you may need help with something, having friends and connections are great!
